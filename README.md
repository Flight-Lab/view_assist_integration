This is the View Assist integration to be used with the View Assist custom sentences and views.  See those files in the main [View Assist Rep](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist)

This integration can be installed by downloading the [view_assist](https://github.com/dinki/view_assist_integration/tree/main/custom_components) directory into your Home Assistant /config/custom_components directory and then restart Home Assistant.  We have plans to make this easier through HACS but are waiting for acceptance.
